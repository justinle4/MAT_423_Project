The objective of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST database, which is imported using the Pytorch module in Python. 
The first approach is to implement the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm to classify the images.
Then, if k-nearest-neighbors does not produce convincing results, then machine learning will be implemented to achieve a more accurate classification.
